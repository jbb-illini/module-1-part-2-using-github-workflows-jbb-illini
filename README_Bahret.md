## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joey. I am currently working on my Master's in Weather and Climate Risk and Data Analytics through UIUC's online master's program. 
I studied meteorology in my undergrad and had a little python experience, but I look forward to seeing how helpful git and github can be in the coding relm.
