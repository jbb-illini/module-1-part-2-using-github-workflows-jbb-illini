This Python script is a simple Rectangle Area Calculator. 
It prompts the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle, then calculates and displays the area. 
The program includes basic input validation to ensure that the user enters positive numerical values.

**Code Structure**

The script is composed of two main functions:

calculate_rectangle_area(length, width): This function takes the length and width as arguments and returns their product, which is the area.

main(): This function handles the user interface. It takes the user's input, validates it, calls the calculate_rectangle_area function, and prints the final result. The try-except block is used to handle potential ValueError if the user's input cannot be converted to a number.

**How to Use**

1. Run the script: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script with Python.

Bash
python Module_1.py

2. Enter the dimensions: The program will ask you to input the length and width of the rectangle. Type in a number for each and press Enter.

View the result: The script will then display the area of the rectangle based on the dimensions you provided. If you enter non-positive or non-numerical values, it will show an error message.
